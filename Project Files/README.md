📝 Project Description:
Book a doctor is a web-based appointment booking platform designed to simplify the process of connecting patients with healthcare providers. It offers a secure and seamless experience for patients, doctors, and administrators to manage appointments, consultations, and platform operations.

This system is inspired by real-world healthcare needs and is modeled as a scenario-based case study, ensuring practical utility and end-to-end functionality.

🌟 Key Features (Scenario-Based Case Study):
👤 1. User Registration
John, a user, visits DocSpot for a routine check-up. He signs up as a Customer using his email and sets a password.

🔍 2. Browsing and Filtering Doctors
After logging in, John is shown a dashboard of available doctors. He filters by specialization, location, or availability.

📅 3. Booking an Appointment
John clicks "Book Now" on a preferred doctor, selects a date, and uploads medical records or insurance documents.
He then receives a confirmation message indicating that the appointment request has been submitted.

✅ 4. Appointment Confirmation
The selected doctor reviews the request and confirms it.
John receives a notification with the appointment date, time, and location. The appointment status changes to “Scheduled.”

🧾 5. Appointment Management
John can view all upcoming appointments in his dashboard.
He can cancel, reschedule, or update appointments as needed.

🛡 6. Admin Approval & Governance
Admins:

Approve doctor registrations

Monitor all platform activities

Enforce privacy policies and resolve disputes

🩺 7. Doctor Dashboard & Management
Doctors like Dr. Smith:

Log in and manage appointments

Confirm/reschedule/cancel as required

Mark appointment status (e.g., Completed, Cancelled)

👨‍⚕️ 8. Consultation Day
John visits Dr. Smith for his consultation.
The doctor provides medical care and may update John’s medical record.
